## Church Ceremony

The baptism will be shorter - less than an hour - and the service will be for Isa.
There will be a short mass, there is no expectation that you take communion. Should be simple and quick.
Baptisms are generally a little fancier in Mexico than in the United States - don't feel obligated to dress
to the 9s but know that people will be a little more dressed up.

## Calenda

Like everything good in Oaxaca, the baptism will be followed by a calenda to the Quinta Real for brunch. Calendas are 
essentially parades with a band, dancers, giant puppets, fireworks, and all of the guests to the event. 
Unlike the calenda at our wedding, there won't be mezcal served. Wear or bring comfortable shoes for several 
blocks of dancing.

## Brunch

Brunch will be served buffet style - eggs, crepes, pancakes, chilaquiles, tamales, and a lot more - starting
at 11 am in Los Lavaderos at Quinta Real. This is an outdoor space and tables will be setup over grass.
