## Church Ceremony

There will be a short mass at 9am in Templo de Santo Domingo, right in the main square. There is no expectation that you take communion. If you are wondering what to wear: a linen shirt (including a guayabera) or a light weight dress would be perfect. The church requires you to wear a mask.

## Calenda

Like everything good in Oaxaca, the baptism will be followed by a calenda to the Quinta Real for brunch. Calendas are 
essentially parades with a band, dancers, giant puppets, fireworks, and all of the guests to the event. 
Unlike the calenda at our wedding, there won't be mezcal served. Wear or bring comfortable shoes for several 
blocks of dancing.

## Brunch

Brunch will be served buffet style - eggs, crepes, pancakes, chilaquiles, tamales, and a lot more - starting
at 11 am in Los Lavaderos at Quinta Real. This is an outdoor space and tables will be setup over grass.
