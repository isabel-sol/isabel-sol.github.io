## Testing

Mexico does not require a negative COVID-19 test to enter the country. However, we encourage you to get tested before traveling. 

As of 18 May 2022 you are still required to have a negative COVID-19 test (antigen or PCR) within 24 hours of travel to the US. 

Tests are extremely accessible in Mexico. Pharmacies and small clinics can provide antigen or PCR tests at very reasonable prices ($5-$40 USD). Many hotels, including Quinta Real, offer complimentary testing before you depart for the US.  

## Facecoverings

We encourage you to wear facecoverings throughout your travel but especially in indoor enclosed spaces. As of May 2022, masks are still used widely used in Mexico. 

The majority of the baptism activities will be taking place outside where masks are optional. Templo Santo Domingo still requires visitors to wear masks. 

## Vaccination

As of 18 May 2022, Mexico does not require vaccination to enter the country. We encourage you to get vaccinated and boosted if you can. 


## COVID-19 protocols during the event

1) If you feel sick - please do not attend. If you have a doubt about exposure, please get tested. You will be sorely missed but we completely understand why you are absent and appreciate your consideration of others.   
2) Masks are required during the baptism ceremony in Templo Santo Domingo.   
3) Depending on conditions in Oaxaca, masks may be required by the state during the Calenda and brunch. If not required, they are encouraged. These parts of the celebration will take place in  outdoor spaces greatly reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission. 


## What to do if you if you get COVID 

- Check if your credit card or travel insurance will cover any expenses incurred during this unexpected event
- Extend your lodging to meet your quarantine period
- Find a doctor or clinic that you can contact should things get worse (medical treatment is generally cheap though private hospital stays will get expensive)
  - You're likely not the first guest to COVID so ask the concierge at your hotel for recommendations 
  - most pharmacies have free doctors that will see you and provide medical advice
- After you recover, you will need proof of recovery from a health professional. See the [cdc's requirements](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/testing-international-air-travelers.html)


## Zika

If you or your partner are pregnant or planning to become pregnant be aware Zika is present in the state of Oaxaca. The city is at higher elevation and the Centro Historico has very good vector control so it is safer than lower/coastal areas.
