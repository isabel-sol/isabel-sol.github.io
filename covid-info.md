## Testing

Mexico does not require a negative COVID-19 test to enter the country. However, we encourage you to get tested before traveling. 

As of 18 May 2022 you are still required to have a negative COVID-19 test (antigen or PCR) within 24 hours of travel to the US. 

Tests are extremely accessible in Mexico. Pharmacies and small clinics can provide antigen or PCR tests at very reasonable prices ($5-$40 USD). Many hotels, including Quinta Real, offer complimentary testing before you depart for the US.  

## Facecoverings

We encourage you to wear facecoverings throughout your travel but especially in indoor enclosed spaces. As of May 2022, masks are still used widely used in Mexico. 

The majority of the baptism activities will be taking place outside where masks are optional. Templo Santo Domingo still requires visitors to wear masks. 

## Vaccination

As of 18 May 2022, Mexico does not require vaccination to enter the country.
